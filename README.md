### Cell Selection Interface

This repository includes a small Tkinter application allowing you to choose from 80 cells arranged in 10 rows and 8 columns. You can toggle an individual cell or an entire row of cells at once.

Run the interface with:

```bash
python3 cell_selector.py
```

When you close the window, the console will print the coordinates of all selected cells.
